# Node.JS-Traveling-Site-Server-Development

Prompt:

The objective of this project is to give you an experience in developing a network application based on the client/server architecture. You are required to build a web application that is used as a simple travelling website. The website allows the users to lookup several travelling destinations. Users should be allowed to create an account, add places to their “want-to-go list” and search for travelling destinations.
